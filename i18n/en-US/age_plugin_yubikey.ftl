-age = age
-yubikey = YubiKey
-yubikeys = YubiKeys
-age-plugin-yubikey = age-plugin-yubikey
-pcscd = pcscd

## CLI commands and flags

-cmd-generate = --generate

-cmd-list     = --list
-cmd-list-all = --list-all

-flag-force  = --force
-flag-serial = --serial

## CLI setup via text interface

cli-setup-intro =
    ‚ú® Let's get your {-yubikey} set up for {-age}! ‚ú®

    This tool can create a new {-age} identity in a free slot of your {-yubikey}.
    It will generate an identity file that you can use with an {-age} client,
    along with the corresponding recipient. You can also do this directly
    with:
    {"    "}{$generate_usage}

    If you are already using a {-yubikey} with {-age}, you can select an existing
    slot to recreate its corresponding identity file and recipient.

    When asked below to select an option, use the up/down arrow keys to
    make your choice, or press [Esc] or [q] to quit.

cli-setup-insert-yk           = ‚è≥ Please insert the {-yubikey} you want to set up.
cli-setup-yk-name             = {$yubikey_name} (Serial: {$yubikey_serial})
cli-setup-select-yk           = üîë Select a {-yubikey}
cli-setup-slot-usable         = Slot {$slot_index} ({$slot_name})
cli-setup-slot-unusable       = Slot {$slot_index} (Unusable)
cli-setup-slot-empty          = Slot {$slot_index} (Empty)
cli-setup-select-slot         = üï≥Ô∏è  Select a slot for your {-age} identity
cli-setup-name-identity       = üìõ Name this identity
cli-setup-select-pin-policy   = üî§ Select a PIN policy
cli-setup-select-touch-policy = üëÜ Select a touch policy

cli-setup-yk4-pin-policy =
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Your {-yubikey} is a {-yubikey} 4 series. With ephemeral applications like
    {-age-plugin-yubikey}, a PIN policy of "Once" behaves like a PIN policy of
    "Always", and your PIN will be requested for every decryption. However, you
    might still benefit from a PIN policy of "Once" in long-running applications
    like agents.
cli-setup-yk4-pin-policy-confirm = Use PIN policy of "Once" with {-yubikey} 4?

cli-setup-generate-new = Generate new identity in slot {$slot_index}?
cli-setup-use-existing = Use existing identity in slot {$slot_index}?

cli-setup-identity-file-name   = üìù File name to write this identity to
cli-setup-identity-file-exists = File exists. Overwrite it?

cli-setup-finished =
    ‚úÖ Done! This {-yubikey} identity is ready to go.

    üîë { $is_new ->
        [true] Here's your shiny new {-yubikey} recipient:
       *[false] Here's the corresponding {-yubikey} recipient:
    }
    {"  "}{$recipient}

    Here are some example things you can do with it:

    - Encrypt a file to this identity:
    {"  "}{$encrypt_usage}

    - Decrypt a file with this identity:
    {"  "}{$decrypt_usage}

    - Recreate the identity file:
    {"  "}{$identity_usage}

    - Recreate the recipient:
    {"  "}{$recipient_usage}

    üí≠ Remember: everything breaks, have a backup plan for when this {-yubikey} does.

## Programmatic usage

open-yk-with-serial    = ‚è≥ Please insert the {-yubikey} with serial {$yubikey_serial}.
open-yk-without-serial = ‚è≥ Please insert the {-yubikey}.

mgr-change-default-pin =
    ‚ú® Your {-yubikey} is using the default PIN. Let's change it!
    ‚ú® We'll also set the PUK equal to the PIN.

    üîê The PIN can be numbers, letters, or symbols. Not just numbers!
    üìè The PIN must be at least 6 and at most 8 characters in length.
    ‚ùå Your keys will be lost if the PIN and PUK are locked after 3 incorrect tries.

mgr-enter-current-puk = Enter current PUK (default is {$default_puk})
mgr-choose-new-pin    = Choose a new PIN/PUK
mgr-repeat-new-pin    = Repeat the PIN/PUK
mgr-pin-mismatch      = PINs don't match
mgr-nope-default-pin  = You entered the default PIN again. You need to change it.

mgr-changing-mgmt-key =
    ‚ú® Your {-yubikey} is using the default management key.
    ‚ú® We'll migrate it to a PIN-protected management key.
mgr-changing-mgmt-key-error =
    An error occurred while setting the new management key.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è SAVE THIS MANAGEMENT KEY - YOU MAY NEED IT TO MANAGE YOUR {-yubikey}! ‚ö†Ô∏è
    {"  "}{$management_key}
mgr-changing-mgmt-key-success = Success!
